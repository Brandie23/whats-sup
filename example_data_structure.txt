SERVICE:

{
  id: "34",
  name: "Sunday lunch roast",
  description: "A shared roast lunch each sunday after the 11am service",
  service_type: "Meals",  // from the service_type table
  service_icon: "meals-kitchen", // represents the icon css class to be applied. from the service_type table
  qty_default: "140", // number of meals in this case 
  qty_remaining: "80",  // will be udpated by poll for provider updates 
  qty_remaining_last_updated: "2018-12-13 18:07:43", // or whatever date format works
  service_status: "Open"
}

// note, no provider_id here, as the service objects are nested in the providerServices "services" array.  The provider id however does exist in the database.

// also, suggest we show qty_remaining always, however if same as qty_default, show as "total qty" (ie. may not be live-updated, so please phone to check), but if different (means provider is live-updating) then show as "live - qty remaining"

#### Note on service status  (n/a for MVP)
|STATUS|purpose|
|---|---|
|PENDING|service has not yet been approved to show |
|ACTIVE|service is approved and in search results|
|INACTIVE|service has been de-listed for some reason|


## DB (Server Side).  NoSQL could be useful for MVP, but a bit of a stretch
  There could be at least four tables for MVP (actually three if we exclude users for MVP, i.e. no Auth yet)
  * services  // this is what shows on the map, has service qty/count
  * service_type // for service classification, icon type (className)
  * providers  // they provide the service, have phone numbers etc
  * users (supplier and admin)
