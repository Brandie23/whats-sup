SERVICE:

{
  id: "34",
  name: "Sunday lunch roast",
  description: "A shared roast lunch each sunday after the 11am service",
  service_type: "Meals",  // from the service_type table
  service_icon: "meals-kitchen", // represents the icon css class to be applied. from the service_type table
  qty_default: "140", // number of meals in this case 
  qty_remaining: "80",  // will be udpated by poll for provider updates 
  qty_remaining_last_updated: "2018-12-13 18:07:43", // or whatever date format works
  service_status: "Open",
  visible_on_map: "true" // depends on search/filtering for current view, i.e. only show shelter-services, not food-kitchen services
}

// note, no provider_id here, as the service objects are nested in the providerServices "services" array.  The provider id however does exist in the database.

// also, suggest we show qty_remaining always, however if same as qty_default, show as "total qty" (ie. may not be live-updated, so please phone to check), but if different (means provider is live-updating) then show as "live - qty remaining"
